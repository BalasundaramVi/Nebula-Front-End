Access the firebase deployed site here at:

<a href="https://nebula-front-end.firebaseapp.com/">https://nebula-front-end.firebaseapp.com/</a>

Deployed using Firebase using the Firebase realtime database.

VueJS, Vuex, and Vue Router were all used for the front-end code.

In case you want to get it up and running locally, you can also read the README.md found in /nebula-forum. The VueCLI has some really easy ways to see the inner workings of the app.

Hope you like it!

As always - feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
